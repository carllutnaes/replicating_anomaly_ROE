## Disclaimer

This repository's purpose is to showcase the general code used for my bachelor thesis. Numbers shown in the Bachelor thesis are not replecated here due to a  few reasons:


- load\_data\_nsdq.R and calculate\_return.R-scripts have been slighty simplified for readability purposes which may affect results.
- load\_data\_nsdq.R has been modified.
- Settings in calculate\_return.R-scripts are modified.
- The scipts making the LaTeX-tables where not finalized and does not save tables shown in the thesis.
